Notes on using OBO-Edit (Updated by G. Mayer January 2012, OBO-Edit version 2.1)
-----------------------

Saving psi-ms.obo from OBO-Edit is tricky.

Before checking in psi-ms.obo, please verify the following:
1) contains the import statement 
2) does not contain terms from the Unit Ontology or other ontologies
3) contains the MS relationships (e.g. part_of, has_units)

psi-ms.obo imports the Unit Ontology (unit.obo) via an import statement at the top of the file:
import: http://unit-ontology.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/unit.obo


We have not figured out yet how to accomplish #1 from within OBO-Edit, so the whole header
must be added manually after saving with OBO-Edit.

To save only the MS terms from OBO-Edit:
1) File/Save As
2) Select Advanced...
3) Select "OBO_1_2" for "Output Type"
4) + (add new "Stored adapter settings" profile)
5) "Save path:" (with browse button) for the output psi-ms.obo file
6) Check "Filter terms"
7) In "Object filtering" choose -> Find terms that:"have" a:"Namespace" that:"contains" the value:"MS"
8) check "Allow dangling parents" (allows has_units UO:xxxxxxx)  
9) check "include is_a closure for cross-referenced terms" 
  (allows the terms from unit.obo to be included 
   as relationship, e.g.: has_units UO:0000166 ! parts per notation)
10) Root selection algorithm :"GREEDY"
11) ID Rules: "Don't write ID rules"
12) Press Ok
13) Once the new obo file is generated, delete the complete header (everything before the first [Term])
    and paste the Header Template (below) with the correct information instead of the XXXXXX

Notes on versioning of the CV:
-------------------------------
Versions of the CV will be revioned: x.y.z
  z means no new term (editing of names or definitions or other minor changes)
  y means new term or obsoletion
  x means change in root level terms (impacts mapping file)
