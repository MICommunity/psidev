Notes on using OBO-Edit
-----------------------

psi-ms.obo imports the Unit Ontology (unit.obo) via an import statement at the top of the file:
import: unit.obo

We would really like to do the following:
import: http://obo.cvs.sourceforge.net/*checkout*/obo/obo/ontology/phenotype/unit.obo
But OBO-Edit has fatal errors on save due to strange characters in unit.obo.

Saving psi-ms.obo from OBO-Edit is tricky.

Before checking in psi-ms.obo, please verify the following:
1) contains the import statement 
2) does not contain terms from the Unit Ontology or other ontologies
3) contains the MS relationships (e.g. part_of, has_units)

We have not figured out yet how to accomplish #1 from within OBO-Edit, so the import statement
must be added manually after saving with OBO-Edit.

To save only the MS terms from OBO-Edit:
1) File/Save As
2) Advanced...
3) + (add new "Stored adapter settings" profile)
4) Add, the Browse (new save path)
5) check "Filter terms"
6) In "Object filtering" choose "Namespace" "contains" "MS"
7) check "Allow dangling parents" (allows has_units UO:xxxxxxx) 
8) select "OBO_1_2" for "Output Type"
9) Ok


Notes on versioning of the CV:
-------------------------------
Versions of the CV will be revioned: x.y.z
  z means no new term (editing of names or definitions or other minor changes)
  y means new term or obsoletion
  x means change in root level terms (impacts mapping file)


Value type and units specification (for easy copy/paste):
---------------------------------------------------------

xref: value-type:xsd\:float "The allowed value-type for this CV term."
xref: value-type:xsd\:int "The allowed value-type for this CV term."
