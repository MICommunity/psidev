<h4>Introduction</h4>
The meeting was opened by Rolf Apweiler (European Bioinformatics Institute).
Henning Hermjakob then explained that, whilst presenting the current status
of the existing PSI projects to the various HUPO committees, a strong community
desire for a standard to allow the storage and exchange of data for the entire
range of proteomics data had been expressed. It was recognised that, at a
minimum, such a standard was essential both for access to published data
and for exchange between collaborators. Due to the complex nature of such
a project, the individual tools may be developed as an overall framework
but certain common components, such as sample preparation techniques and
protein representation, could be shared.<br>
<br>
A series of presentations were followed where examples of such systems were
described.<br>
<br>
<b>Steven Oliver, University of Manchester, UK </b><br>
The increasing volume of proteomic data demands a robust representation of
both methodology used and results obtained whilst remaining flexible enough
to encompass future developments. PEDRo has been developed to encode laboratory
produced data, producing an XML-based PEML&nbsp; (Proteomics Experiment Mark-up
Language) file for local storage or submission to a repository. Any such repository
would need to be capable of validating the data, and have an associated set
of software tools capable of extracting and analysing the data.<br>
<br>
PEDRo allows the storage of sample origin and processing, mass spectroscopy
data and in silico analysis.&nbsp; A prototype data entry tool has been developed
that reflects the hierarchical nature of the XML schema and contains a number
of mandatory fields, which could form the basis of minimal data required for
submission to a repository. The consistent XML tree allows for an audit trail
to be established. The entry currently requires a large amount of accompanying
data but templates are available when information is common to many entries.
The data is interrogated at Manchester using GIMS (Genome Information Management
System) which allows complex queries linking both transcriptome and proteome.
Images can be stored within PEDRo but the system is not currently set up to
allow image comparison.<br>
<br>
A practical demonstration of the system was given by Chris Taylor (Manchester)
The PEML schema is being made available via the web in order to encourage
usage and debate over the future direction of the project. Software will be
open source with the <a href="http://pedro.man.ac.uk/uc.htm">XML schema</a>
being released first.<br>
<br>
<b>Sangyun Cho, Yonsei University, Korea&nbsp; </b><br>
YPRC-PDC has been designed to systematically organise, store and analyse proteomic
data - the example given being that from human liver samples. It can act
as a repository of data in various formats and has a dynamic user report
system linked to a reference protein database. The system has been designed
to handle clinical data and sample preparation details. Mass spectrometry
data is input as a text file from which the system can generate graphical
images. Non-confidential data will be released over the next 12 months and
could be converted into any XML-based exchange format agreed by the community.
The system is also to be offered as a public service to which individual research
groups can connect via the internet and use to manage their own experimental
results. Alternatively, the group plan to distribute KAST, a simplified version
of the database based on My-SQL and Linux.<br>
<br>
<b>Martin Bl&uuml;ggel, Protagen AG, Dortmund, Germany </b><br>
Automated handling of high throughput data generated from brain proteome analysis
has been achieved by using meta-scoring of the readouts from several different
analytical machines. Scores are boosted by the use of multi-step calibration
based on known contaminants and internal calibrants and noise-out filters.
A PTM explorer checks for PTM by systematic permutation and cross correlation
to identified proteins. Data management is hierarchically structured and
gel images are stored at low resolution. Sample preparation is described through
protocols and MS data imported as peak lists using 6 different algorithms
to handle the output from different vendors. <br>
<br>
A pilot project looking at the proteome of mouse brain identified 818 spots
(estimated 8-10% of total) which were shown to derive from 417 unique proteins.
&nbsp;<br>
<br>
<h4>Open discussion</h4>
An open debate then followed on the potential structure of any tool adopted
globally for handling proteomic data, with the more immediate problem of assisting
laboratories participating in HUPO initiatives to store and exchange the
information they generate. There was some feeling that only minimal data should
be stored in any public repository, with detail being maintained in local
LIMS, however it was also recognised that technology in this area is currently
in flux, and being too prescriptive may compromise attempts to analyse the
data in the future. Biologists will require a simple single system and not
wish to enter information into many different databases - a modular system
where repetitive data could be stored in common protocols may go some way
towards solving this. Development would need to start in well-defined areas,
such as 2-DE and mass spectrometry; technical developments could be tackled
by developing ontologies which would update whilst the schema remained constant.<br>
<br>
It was observed that instrument manufacturers would have to be involved from
an early stage to provide a common input format. Any repository should be
designed with the searches, which would be performed over the data in mind,
however these would be difficult to predict. The merits of starting with an
existing system, such as PEDRo were debated. There were some reservations
in that PEDRo may be regarded as a LIMS rather than a data repository but
it could be used to feed any eventual repository. PEDRo also lacks practical
testing at laboratory level. However, there was a consensus of agreement that
PEDRo should be opened up for criticism and discussion and would provide a
practical starting point for the development of a tool for handling proteomics
data.<br>
<br>
The meeting then separated into two sessions - the Mass Spectrometry and Protein-Protein
Interaction groups.<br>
<br>
<h4>Mass Spectrometry</h4>
The meeting of the mass spectrometry group, chaired by Weimin Zhu (EBI) began
with a report of a preliminary meeting that had been held between lead players
in the first PSI meeting and hardware and software vendors.&nbsp; In this
meeting, the vendors had expressed a strong willingness to establish and support
a standard representation for proteomics-related mass-spectrometry data.&nbsp;
Randall Julian (Eli Lilley), the chair of the ASTM (American Society for
Tests and Measurements) committee E01.25, which is responsible for an existing
mass spectrometry standard, presented this to both the preliminary meeting
and the open session.&nbsp; The E01.25 standard has the strongest vendor
support of all existing standards; but its scope does not cover all types
mass spectrometry experiments, and it is implemented in netCDF, which is
not a highly descriptive format.&nbsp; Recently, two other putative standards
have emerged, both using XML representations: SpectroML, and GAML, and a second
ASTM committee, E13, is looking at expanding their scope to create a general
standard for mass spectrometry to replace the E01.25 standard.&nbsp;&nbsp;
However, all existing standards focus on "raw" mass spectrometry data, i.e.
the direct output produced by an instrument; and not on its subsequent extension
to proteomics. &nbsp;<br>
<br>
In general discussions, it was felt useful to attempt to define a standard
representation for annotated peak lists (i.e. peak lists plus peptide and
protein identifications); and to insert such a representation into the emerging
standard for raw mass spectrometry data.&nbsp; Randall agreed to steer a collaborative
sharing of the XML schemae already developed by participating vendors, with
the intention of reporting back to the PSI within 3 months.&nbsp; PSI could
contribute to the process by providing a specification of what information
researchers in the field of proteomics would find useful to have captured
within such a standard.<br>
<br>
The open session continued with a presentation from Yixue Yu (HUPO Liver Workgroup)
who presented the bioinformatics efforts that are occurring as part of the
Human Liver Proteome Project.&nbsp; A comprehensive system has been designed
to capture and analyse many sorts of proteomic data, including those derived
from mass spectrometry experiments.&nbsp; Dr. Yu expressed a willingness
to support a new standard emerging from the PSI process.<br>
<br>
In subsequent general discussion, both the scope of the group and the minimum
requirements for a possible repository were discussed.&nbsp; To maximise the
interpretability of the results, the full biological context of an experiment
(as described in a paper) would need to be deposited; to maximise reproducibility,
the full details of the "raw" experiment (at the instrument-level) would need
to be captured.&nbsp; The desire to be able to understand, compare and (to
some extent) repeat experiments was agreed upon, but practical, technical
and size limitations make the complete achievement of these goals impossible.<br>
<br>
To move forward, the group split into two working parties under Pierre-Alain
Binz (Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics) and Kathryn Lilley (Cambridge Centre
for Proteomics).&nbsp; These groups took pieces of the PEDRo data model (as
defined in PEML) as a concrete starting point for working on the definition
of data structures to hold information on mass spectrometry experiments and
their interpretation, and on "pre-MS", i.e. the proteomic sample preparation
techniques that are necessary to produce the material that is subsequently
evaluated by mass spectrometry.<br>
<br>
Both groups made good progress.&nbsp; The "pre-MS" group designed a flexible
data structure for proteomics experiments with separative (e.g. chromatographic)
and analytical (e.g. spectrometric) phases to support configurable workflows.&nbsp;
The group also designed detailed models for many particular separative techniques.
The group listened to a presentation from Ugis Sarkis (EBI), a member of the
MGED consortium that has helped define standards for transcriptomics experiments,
a domain with some natural overlap to proteomics.<br>
<br>
The "MS" workgroup, meanwhile, focused their discussion on clearly defining
the many different levels at which data is produced or interpreted during
a mass spectrometry experiment; and focused in particular on the key question
of the representation of peak lists.<br>
<br>
<br>
<h4>Protein:Protein Interactions</h4>
The session was opened by a number of presentations.<br>
<br>
<b>Michael Lappe, European Bioinformatics Institute</b><br>
The understanding of the proteome through protein:protein interactions (PPIs)
could result in an accurate description of protein function and reliable structural
annotation but this is complicated by the large potential number of pairings,
with additional levels of complexity added by PTMs, splice variants and time-dependent
protein expression. A method to limit the number of laboratory experiments
required to confirm potential PPIs has been sought. A virtual pull-down experiment
lead to a graph of all known PPIs. The average connectivity of a protein
is 2-4 interactions, confirming highly connected (&gt;4) nodes first speeds
the process of exploring a new interactome by up to 5-fold. Data from external
sources - expression data, text-mining, homology studies can be used to strengthen
the evidence. The algorithm can then be run over any database and will predict
which proteins should be the next to be examined experimentally. Results
obtained to date suggests the algorithm operates within 70-80% of a theoretical
optimum.<br>
<br>
<b>Gary Bader, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center</b><br>
A number of databases storing and displaying data on biological pathways (signalling
and metabolic) are looking for a common format with which to exchange data.
The group is affiliated to the BioPathways consortium and hope to have buy-in
from all of the major databases should a format be agreed upon. The group
are attempting to capitalise on the work of a number of related projects,
such as the PPI data exchange format and CML (chemical mark-up language)
to describe small molecules. Any model needs to be programming language independent
and needs to be extensible, with a fairly loose definition of the concept
of pathway, to encapsulate one pathway into one record, to be compatible
with existing standards and ontologies and flexible enough such that co-operating
databases do not have to change their own definition of a pathway. A BioPAX
record contains a set of entities with the option of defining types, states
and attributes. Timing of changes in both the state of an entity and in its
relationships, including translocation, can all be included in a record.
Evidence sources can also be listed, for example a PubMed reference. A small
core group is currently advancing the standard, with a larger group contributing
via a mailing list.<br>
<br>
<b>Yves Deville, Universit&eacute; Catholique de Louvain </b><br>
aMAZE is one example of a database containing both PPI and pathway information
which could benefit from a close co-operation between the PSI PPI data exchange
format and the BioPAX initiatve. aMAZE contains both metabolic and signal
transduction data described in an object-orientated model which is capable
of handling information on proteins, nucleic acids and small molecules. The
ability to see PPIs in a functional context leads to the development of biochemical
networks, the ability to model complexes, molecular states, activation/inactivation
and changes in location is paramount.<br>
<br>
<b>Christian von Mering, EMBL</b><br>
In order to compare and benchmark different data sets, a common ground for
comparison which can deal with different data types needs to be established.
Known interactions can be mapped onto a 2D map of function which demonstrates
that no one method of demonstrating PPI e.g. yeast 2-hybrid (Y2H) or TAP shows
a pattern of linking to function but there is some indication that methods
are complementary. Genomic association can be indicative of a functional interactions
- this includes methods such as looking for a pattern of genes present and
absent when genomes are compared, a conserved neighbourhood such as an operon
in prokaryotic genomes and gene fusion events. STRING is a database into
which a protein sequence I.D. may be input and an in silico analysis of both
interaction and function will then be made. <br>
<br>
PPI methodologies show a strong bias towards high abundance proteins in terms
of interaction coverage, although this is not true of Y2H or synthetic lethals.
A trade-off is always seen between accuracy and coverage of PPI measurement.
<br>
<br>
<b>Henning Hermjakob, EBI</b><br>
The current status of the XML model which was produced as a result of discussions
at the first PSI and further refined via the e-mail discussion list was described.
A key question was how far the model would need to be refined to ensure compatibility
with BioPAX, and whether this could be achieved without loosing simplicity
and ease of use. The current model also cannot deal with different levels
of confidence in interactions within a dataset, for example, the Cellzome
dataset is known to contain "sticky" proteins which form non-specific interactions
with many proteins. The effect of an interaction being seen twice within one
entry on confidence scores was also discussed.<br>
<br>
<b>Luisa Montecchi, University of Rome</b><br>
A number of controlled vocabularies have been developed, initially for use
in the IntAct project but it has now been agreed that these will be made available
to describe aspects of experimental design and implementation within the
PPI data exchange format. Following some discussion, it was agreed to group
these using a DAG format (following the GO model) rather than a hierarchy.
A procedure to add new terms was discussed and Luisa agreed to continue to
act as an editor with back-up being supplied by further volunteers. <br>
<br>
<h4>Open discussion</h4>
The session was then declared open and further discussion of the XML model
ensued. The model was extensively reworked to allow for BioPAX compatibility
resulting in a generic list of interactors described in the entry being listed
at the top level of each entry. Each interactor can be described via a pointer
to the generic list, by a feature table, and by its role in the interaction
- additional information such as tagged protein or over-expressed protein
can also be added but this may cause some problems when other classes of interactor
are added to the model. Final conversion to BioPAX format could be scripted
to be effected by the push of a button by biologists. Confidence levels may
now optionally be described at 3 levels - the interaction, the interactors
and the experimental protocol. Each entry can be stamped with an experimental
date(s), a submission date and an exchange date. <br>
<br>
There was further discussion on the problem of an interaction being seen twice
within one entry. This could be collapsed into one entry but it was decided
this should not be part of the standard but could be provided as a data-processing
option. <br>
<br>
&nbsp;A web-page is to be started on which level 2 issues will be collected
- currently other molecule types (including small molecules), organelle encoded
proteins, PTMs/cleavge as a result of an interaction and maintaining compatibility
with BioPAX are seen as issues. <br>
<br>
A report of the first PSI meeting will appear in Comparative and Functional
Genomics and a follow-up article on this meeting has also been requested by
the journal. A wider range of journals willing to accept a short article or
paragraph describing progress to date will also be actively sought. A major
publication containing the XML schema, controlled vocabularies and future
plans will be written for submission to Bioinformatics. All participants in
the meeting will be invited to be on the author list, as will known additional
contributors, BioPAX and P.I.s of contributors. Personnel at the EBI and Luisa
Montecchi will undertake actual writing of the first draft.<br>
<br>
Deliverables All tools and deliverables should be in place for the submission
of the paper i.e. by end February 2003, the infra-structure will need to be
in place by publication (April, May). The following were seen as deliverables:<br>
<br>
<ol>
  <li>Databases actively providing data download in the standard format (within
this year).</li>
  <li>Software - to include</li>
  <ol>
    <li>Style sheets to allow unfolding of pointers and downloading of data
in tree-like format.</li>
    <li>PSI-BioPAX conversion tool</li>
  </ol>
  <li>Documentation, examples and use-cases</li>
</ol>
<br>
<b>Action Items</b><br>
<ol>
  <li>Finish XML format and maintain via CVS - Henning Hermjakob</li>
  <li>Style sheets - David Sherman and Lucasz Salwinski</li>
  <li>Use cases - David Sherman</li>
  <li>Documentation - Henning Hermjakob and Gary Bader (Luisa Montecchi and
Sandra Orchard to check for ease of understanding by biologists)</li>
  <li>Controlled vocabularies - Luisa Montecchi (to be submitted as additional
material for the paper)</li>
  <li> Example data sheet - J&eacute;r&ocirc;me Wojcik, Hybrigenics</li>
  <li>Request official HUPO sanction - Henning Hermjakob</li>
</ol>
<br>
A versioning system should be included in the specification - this should
be managed via a CVS tag which would update automatically on minor releases,
the version would be manually updated on a major release.<br>
<br>
It was further suggested that place-holders be built into the XML schema to
allow users to customise it for internal use. All software built to the standard
would ignore anything placed in these positions but if the contents proved
useful, they could be built into the next level. This can be discussed by
e-mail once the schema is complete.<br>
<br>
The paper will need to list support from databases - BIND, DIP, MINT, IntAct,
Hybrigenics are on board, STRING to confirm, Cellzome, Holger Husi (PPID)
and Bernard Jacq (GIN-DB) to be contacted. All participating databases should
put the PSI logo on the web and link to the exchange format website. <br>
<br>
Once the exchange format is public and databases are ready to accept submissions,
we will approach journals with regard to an obligate submissions policy -
this could take the form of an open letters addressed to the editor, as used
by the MGED consortium.<br>
<br>
Data exchange between databases has political implications which will be addressed
after the release of the exchange format. Lukasz Salkinski offered to write
a tool to allow initial merging of entries from more than one database into
a common format.&nbsp; This was seen as a desirable&nbsp; -other tools may
also be written by users and the web site should encourage their publication
for use by other groups. <br>
<br>
Future Plans The exchange format needs to be released and utilised before
it is worth discussing further development - it was agreed that there is little
point in meeting before the second HUPO convention in October. At this point,
updates to Level 1 and the content of Level 2 could be discussed.<br>
<br>
Common grant proposals were briefly discussed - the E.S.F. will fund workshops
with a possibility of a 5 year funding for conferences, travel and seminars
to advertise the new standard. Alphonso Valencia will investigate this in
more detail.&nbsp; The Marie Curie Foundation may also be willing to sponsor
a meeting.<br>
<br>
