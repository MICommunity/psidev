          of the Second Annual Proteomics Standards Initiative Spring Workshop<br>
  Siena, Italy 17-20th April 2005</span></strong></span></p>
<p><strong><em>Introduction</em></strong></p>
<p>The Second Annual Spring Workshop of the Proteomics Standards Initiative (PSI)
  was jointly hosted by the University of Siena and the Italian Human Proteomics
  Organisation (HUPO). The meeting was opened by Henning Hermjakob (EMBL-EBI),
  who reviewed the activities to date of HUPO and in particular of the Bioinformatics
  Committee of which the PSI is the major activity. The Level 2.0 Molecular Interaction
  standards (PSI-MI) has been published in beta format, and an increasing number
  of databases are now making their data available in this format. MINT already
  release their data in both PSI-MI Level 1 and 2(beta), IntAct will do so from
  May onwards, DIP from June/July and Mpact (MIPS). BIND make their data available
  in PSI-MI Level 2(beta). Communication between these groups has been so successful
  that it has lead to the formation of the IMEx (International Molecular Interaction
  Exchange) consortium which will eventually exchange curated molecular interaction
  data following the nucleotide database consortium model. The work of the PSI-MI
  group would now concentrate on refining the current schema to allow more complete
  data exchange, extend the current controlled vocabularies where needed and
  look at developing further tools such as an XML validator and a PSI Common
  Query Interface (PSIQIC).</p>
<p>Chris Taylor (EMBL-EBI) then outlined the overall concept of the General Proteomics
  Standard (GPS) which will enable the increased systematic capture of all aspects
  of proteomics data. The already existing standards for Mass Spectrometry and
  Molecular Interactions (mzData and mzIdent) will exist as components within
  this model and other modules are currently in preparation. It is envisaged
  that the PSI-GPS model will be integrated with the MGED model in areas of overlap,
  such as sample preparation, to produce the Functional Genomics Experimental
  Model (FuGE) which will allow of full description of experiments where parallel
  samples are analysed by both microarray and proteomics techniques. Discussion
  with the NIH has identified the common representation of PTMs as a need by
  all proteomics groups, and discussion of this subject was to be an additional
  track for this meeting. The GPS standards will allow common representation
  of both methods and data but are not to be quality guidelines, although how
  data quality could be best represented within these models was to be a subject
  for discussion. MzData (Version 1.05) is now in a stable release structure
  and has received strong vendor support, mzIdent should be in a mature form
  by the HUPO congress in 2005. Work was to begin at this workshop to develop
  standards for 2D gel electrophoresis.</p>
<p>The MIAPE documentation is proceeding with a series of technology specific
  guidelines outlining the detail required to describe a proteomics experiment
  in sufficient detail to ensure full understanding of the experimental protocols
  utilised. The Mass Spectrometry document has been through expert review and
  is approaching release, the Proteoinformatics for Mass Spectrometry documentation
  is available in draft format. An abstract GPS object model has also been prepared
  (PSI-OM) and once mature, this will be used to derive an XML data exchange
  schema. Common ontologies for all aspects of this work are under development,
  although there is still some debate as to whether these should be fully developed
  ontologies using formats such as OWL or simpler Controlled Vocabularies (CV)
  as have already been designed and implemented by the PSI-MI group (Luisa Montecchi-Palazzi,
  EBI).</p>
<p>  The sessions separated into three major tracks; <a href="#gps">GPS</a>, <a href="#mi">Molecular
  Interactions</a>  and <a href="#ms">Mass Spectrometry</a>.</p>
<p><span style="font-family: times new roman; font-size: 18px;"><strong><a name="mi" id="mi"></a></strong></span></p>
<p><strong><em><br>
Molecular Interactions</em></strong></p>
<p>  The session was chaired by Henning Hermjakob who summarised the advances made
    by the group over the last few months. A series of presentations then followed,
    in which a number of databases outlined both their experience in implementing
    PSI-MI Level 1.0 (Matthias Oesterheld Mpact (MIPS), Peter Woollard GSK, Arnaud
    Coel MINT, Samuel Kerriens IntAct) and the conversion from PSI-MI 1.0 to
    2.0beta. Requirements for changes to the PSI-MI XML format which needed to
    be decided upon during his meeting were reviewed, requests have been collected
    all year using the SourceForge site. The aim of the meeting was to bring
    the PSI-MI Level 2 schema to an appropriate state of maturity for publication
    and full release (Level 2.5).</p>
<p>The addition of further CVs allowed an overall simplification of the XML schema,
  with attributes which were previously separately listed, for example &#8220;Protein
  Interactor&#8221;, &#8220;DNA Inteactor&#8221; now being described by a single
  field &#8220;Interactor&#8221; filled from a CV &#8220;Interactor Type&#8221;.
  Further typing of aliases allows full description of the molecule, whilst extension
  of the ExperimentalForm&#8221; of the molecule means that the exact state of
  the molecule used in a specific experiment, for example deletion mutants or
  tagged molecules, can be identified and linked to that experiment. This also
  allows the exchange of more complex data sets, such as a modelled interaction
  which can be directly linked to the experimental evidence from which it was
  derived. </p>
<p>The need to be able to fully describe complexes was identified, including
  the hierarchical build up of the final form from any number of sub-complexes.
  This requires adding the concept of &#8220;unknown&#8221; participant since
  the components may only be partially identified e.g. five proteins separated
  on a gel but only two identified by subsequent Western blot. The ability of
  an interaction to be used as an interactor &#8220;Complex&#8221; is now recognised
  which will refer back to either an internal interaction reference or a cross-reference
  to an eternal database.</p>
<p>In total, the addition of 9 further CVs was decided upon, and changes to those
  already existing were agreed upon Curator requests are made upon the SourceForge
  tracker system and discussed by an editorial board, as agreed at the Spring
  2003 workshop. The conversion from PSI-MI 1.0 to 2.0beta or 2.5 will require
  a certain amount of remapping and plans to publish details of this will be
  published on the SourceForge website.</p>
<p>  The need for published Minimal Curation Standards was emphasised by the Industry
    Representatives, who wish to pass these on to third-party vendors of interaction
    data. A &#8220;Minimal Information for Molecular Interaction experiment (MIMI)&#8221; document
    will be written by experienced curators from the public domain databases
    and made publicly available </p>
<p>  The production of a number of tools to assist in the best usage of the PSI-MI
    XML interchange format was discussed including update of the exsting PSI-maker
    which converts of tab delineated flat file into PSI-MI format. Yhia tool
    could also be adapted to convert between Levels 1 and 2, via a flat file
    intermediate. XML syntactical and semantical validators will also be written
    to check the validity of the ML files and that CVs have been employed in
    the correct places. By taking advantage of certain dependencies between CVs
    (for example Yeast 2-hybrid experiments must always have a bait and prey
    in the BiologicalRole) rules can be written to check data quality and consistency. </p>
<p>Finally the first draft of the PSI-MI Common Query Interface (PSICQIC) was
  discussed. This is envisaged as a common interface which will be offered by
  all participating databases in which a few simple queries will be delivered
  by query language and a valid PSI_MI document returned. Syntax, error messages
  etc. should be matched to cPath (BioPax) to make understanding easier for users
  of both services. An initial specification should be produced within the next
  3 months, with a view to further discussion at the HUPO Munich congress. </p>
<p>It is planned to have the updated schema (PSI-MI 2.5) ready for implementation
  and testing by mid-May 2005 with full release by mid-September.</p>

<p><strong><em><br>
Mass Spectrometry</em></strong></p>
<p>The major aims of this workshop session, chaired by Randall Julian (Eli-Lilly)
  and Weimin Zhu (EBI), were to revise and consolidate the mzData format constructed
  during the last PSI-MS workshop to work with the supporting controlled vocabularies
  (CV) and to extend the PSI-MS initiative to the area of molecular identifications
  using mass spectrometry, mzIdent.</p>
<p>mzData has now been implemented by a number of vendors, for example the standard
  is now available in Mascot, Phenyx, X! and Bioworks with Proteios citation
  currently underway. An annual schema release will give sufficient stability
  for manufacturers whilst still keeping the standard up to date, additional
  flexibility will be given by a semi-annual CV release. The next minor mzData
  release will allow an XML namespace and versioning. </p>
<p>  The base controlled vocabulary for mzData defines information items which are
    shared across all experiments and instrument makers All terms include a conserved
    accession number which is guaranteed to remain constant with the definition
    until deprecated allowing update of the associated text name without loss
    of information. The CV has been merged with that of mzXML developed by the
    ISB and distributed as mzXML.xsd. To ensure the ability to create HUPO submission
    documents from workflows using such schema, a unified controlled vocabulary
    was obtained by assigning HUPO accession numbers to all terms included in
    both the HUPO-PSI schema and the ISB XML schema. When complete, all fixed
    and variable attributes in mzXML will be mapped to corresponding HUPO-PSI
    ontology terms and both will be consistent with the IUPAC nomenclature for
    mass spectrometry. The first version of the mzData CV is currently on SourceForge
    in spreadsheet format. There will be a further release around August 2005,
    in OWL format.</p>
<p>  The mzIdent standard is being designed to capture results from MS search engines
    and represent the input parameters for analysis algorithms, thus unifying
    results from different search engines. The requirements for mzIdent include
    the need to support the identification of both protein and peptides, by accession
    number or sequence, and must include the ability to describe modifications.
    Small molecule identification by either CML or SMILES must also be supported.
    The possibility of splitting the schema into two, to deal with proteins and
    peptides separately, was discussed but it was finally decided that adopting
    one schema in which the molecule type was generalized would allow more flexibility.
    The file format will now include 3 major elements, that are cross-referenced
    to each other - a molecular descriptor, an analysis results descriptor and
    an analysis descriptor. </p>
<p>The molecule descriptor might describe the structural information of a molecule
  (descriptor, sequence, PTMs, structure), and references to the results. The
  relationship between molecules, for example peptides as part of proteins will
  need to be clearly defined, allowing previous results to be used as source
  evidence. Analysis results might includes scores, spectrum annotation, reference
  to originating spectra/analysis and to the matched molecule. The analysis descriptor
  may contain name and version of the search engine and search parameters and
  can refer to a protocol to define a series of analyses. It also cross-references
  to the mzData file . A number of use cases for the schema were established,
  and the need for naming within mzIdent and for the overall structure of the
  schema to be consistent with that of mzData was emphasised.</p>
<p>A working group which will concentrate on the further development of MzIdent
  has been established and will aim to report significant progress at the HUPO
  congress in Munich.</p>

<p><strong><em><br>
Post-translational modifications</em></strong></p>
<p>The identification of post-translational modifications, and an understanding
  of their functional significance is key to all areas of proteomics. The joint
  session started with presentations by John Garavelli (EBI) and David Creasy
  (Matrix Science Ltd.) on the RESID and UniMod databases, respectively. The
  RESID Database of Protein Modifications is a comprehensive collection of annotations
  and structures for protein modifications and cross-links including pre-, co-,
  and post-translational modifications, concentrating on naturally-occurring
  protein modifications. UniMod is a database of protein modifications for use
  in mass spectrometry applications and contains values for the mass differences
  introduced by both natural and artificial modifications.</p>
<p>The PSI-MI group has already produced a CV of natural modifications, based
  on the information in RESID. It was recognized that for use in mass spectrometry
  such a CV would have to include artificial modifications and a CV that includes
  both aspects will be produced, for use by all modules within the GPS model. </p>
<p><span style="font-family: times new roman; font-size: 18px;"><strong><a name="gps" id="gps"></a></strong></span></p>
<p><strong><em><br>
General Proteomics Standard</em></strong></p>
<p>The session, chaired by Chris Taylor, started with a review of the current
  status of the MIAPE documentation. This initiated a debate as to the whether
  the standards should encompass a &#8220;minimum quality of data&#8221; suitable
  for publication. It was felt that decisions on data quality should ultimately
  be made by the journals and that data capture needs to be complete to enable
  such decisions to be made. However the possibility of a &#8220;MIAPE Light&#8221; which
  would describe a subset of the data, which would be required for deposition
  in a repository prior to publication may be further discussed with the proteomics
  journals.</p>
<p>Four MIAPE documents are in various stages of completion</p>
<p>&#8226; The 'Parent' Document<br>
  &#8226; 
  Mass Spectrometry (MS)<br>
&#8226; 
  MS Informatics (MSI)<br>
&#8226; 
  Gel Electrophoresis (GE)</p>
<p>Following discussion, the GE document was further split into GE and GE Informatics.
  The version of the MS document which was submitted to the reviewers was circulated
  and lead to a debate as to whether or not delivery systems should be incorporated
  into the MS document - MALDI / SELDI are currently integrated into the document
  but HPLC columns are seen as a separate enough issue to justify an individual
  document. More specific points included adding a requirement to record the
  reasonable sensitivity range of the instrument, details of the voltage step-through
  process for MALDI post-source decay and it was noted that mass accuracy is
  determined on the day by calibration and this result should be recorded. For
  some instruments the parameters file may not exist, so there is a need to provide
  guidance on what to do under these circumstances. Finally, the MS Informatics
  document was given a preliminary review. The description of experimental controls
  was clarified and it noted that mzData should be added to the list of peak
  list formats. Further clarification will be required of the type of spectra
  that should be included as the raw data may be processed directly. For output,
  both expected and observed masses of proteins and peptides should be recorded &#8211; this
  will aid in the identification of PTMs although the lack of a CV for artefactual
  PTMs was observed as an issue. </p>
<p>The group then went on to produce detailed design specifications for Gel-ML,
  the XML format for capture and interchange of GE data which will form another
  module within the GPS data model. In analogy to the MS data, two formats will
  be required:<br>
  Gel-ML to capture the process of running a gel, capturing an image associated
  with a minimal experimental description<br>
  GelImAnML (working title) to capture the analysis of an image, to draw in quantitation
  and also to allow the inclusion of images not related to an actual gel, for
  example
  average gels, artificial gels and test images.</p>
<p>Work on the production of PSI-OM, an abstract model to describe a proteomics
  experiment, was also advance over the course of the workshop. The model will
  be implementation independent and will be neither hierarchical nor relational.
  A standard XML schema derived from the model is currently being written and
  a reference-only database will follow. Both the object model and XML schema
  are expected to be mature by the Spring 2006 PSI workshop.</p>
<p>The writing of ontologies is key to the entire modelling process and the area
  where &#8220;omics&#8221; technologies converge, in that common methodologies
  can be described by common vocabularies. All-encompassing ontologies need to
  be usable, accessible and addressable by users. Finally, details of the FuGE
  object model were described by Angel Pizarro as an example of one potential
  schema that could be shared by transcriptomics, proteomics and metabolomics;
  facilitating the generation of data sets containing heterogeneous data from
  several omics platforms.</p>
<p><span style="font-family: times new roman; font-size: 18px;"><strong><a name="summary" id="summary"></a></strong></span></p>
<p><strong><em><br>
Summary</em></strong></p>
<p>Significant progress was made in all areas over the course of the workshop.
  The PSI-MI standard has already been widely adopted by both data producers
  and users but the changes made to the schema during these four days have increased
  the overall simplicity of the model whilst enabling the exchange of more complex
  data types, such as complexes and modeled interactions. The introduction of
  new CVs will make it easier to both parse the data and to filter out unwanted
  datasets. Additional tools will be provided to aid in conversion between the
  different PSI-MI levels and to improve data quality. The PSI-MS mzData standard
  is now being prepared for formal publication but has already been implemented
  by a number of hardware and software manufacturers, with more expected to follow
  suit in the near future. The specification for mzIdent has now been fully laid
  out and it is expected that version 1.0 will be released by the end of 2005.
  All this work, along with that of the newly formed groups looking at the exchange
  of gel image and analysis data will be brought together under the umbrella
  of the GPS, which is now working both on producing a working object model and
  in the production on ontologies which, in many cases will be shared by many
  applications and have more wider usage than solely the field of proteomics.
  One obvious example of this is the CV for protein modification which is to
  be written for usage across all the GPS modules. </p>
