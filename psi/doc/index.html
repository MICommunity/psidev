	<center><h2>Proteomics Standards Initiative</h2></center>
	<h3>Mission Statement</h3>
	The Proteomics Standards Initiative (PSI) aims to define 
	community standards for data representation in proteomics to
	facilitate data comparision, exchange and verification, similar to
	the now widely accepted standard for microarray data developed by
	the Microarray Gene Expression Data
	society (<a href="http://www.mged.org/">MGED</a>).
	<p>
	  The Proteomics Standards Initiative was founded at the HUPO
	  meeting in Washington, April 28-29, 2002 (see <a
							   href="http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/summary/296/5569/827?maxtoshow=&HITS=10&hits=10&RESULTFORMAT=&searchid=1027414274815_1591&stored_search=&FIRSTINDEX=0&volume=296&firstpage=827&fdate=10/1/1995&tdate=7/31/2002">Science 296, 827</a>). As a first step, the PSI will develop standards for two key
	  areas of proteomics: <a href="#ms">mass spectrometry</a> and <a href="#ppi">protein-protein
	    interaction</a> data.

	  <h3>Work groups</h3>
	  <h4>Protein-Protein interaction</h4>
	  Several well-established databases for protein-protein interaction
	  data exist, including <a href="http://www.bind.ca">BIND</a>, <a href="http://dip.doe-mbi.ucla.edu/">DIP</a>, <a href="http://cbm.bio.uniroma2.it/mint/">MINT</a>, and the <a href="http://mips.gsf.de/proj/yeast/tables/interaction/">MIPS interaction
	    tables</a>. However, their data are provided in many different formats and are not synchronised. In addition, many
	  data producers offer only their data from their own web sites,
	  again in different formats. The tedious work of combining the data
	  from different data sources is performed over and over again.
	  <p> 
	    The aim of the PSI is to develop a common data standard that will
	    allow users to retrieve all relevant data from different sites and
	    perform comparative analysis of different data sets much more easily than
	    is currently possible. The standard will define a minimal data model
	    that allows scientists to provide core data, but refer back to
	    the original data  
	    source for full information, in particular for complex, fully curated
	    entries.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    As a long-term aim, the standard should allow a synchronisation
	    of the core data between public protein interaction database
	    providers, similar to the synchronisation of nucleotide data
	    between EMBL, GenBank and DDBJ.   
	  </p>

	    <h4>Mass spectrometry</h4>
	    Currently, widely accepted public repositories for mass spectra
	    do not exist; experimental results are usually compared against a
		database of theoretical spectra calculated from protein
	    databases. It is well known, however, that theoretical and real
	    spectra for given proteins often differ significantly, in an
	    unpredictable, but reproducible way.  
	    <p>
		  The aim of the PSI is to evaluate how to improve the identification of
	      unknown proteins by using a database of experimental spectra of
	      known peptides. To facilitate the comparison of spectra and their
	      correct classification, for example according to instrument type, a
	      standard representation of experimental spectra will be
	      developed.
