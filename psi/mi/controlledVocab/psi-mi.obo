A typical ITC experiment is carried out by the stepwise addition of one of the reactants (~10-6 L per injection) into the reaction cell (~1mL) containing the second reactant. The chemical reaction occurring after each injection either releases or absorbs heat (qi) proportional to the amount of ligand that binds to the protein with a characteristic binding enthalpy (DH). As modern ITC instruments operate on the heat compensation principle\, the instrumental response (measured signal) is the amount of power (microcalories per second) necessary to maintain constant the temperature difference between the reaction and the reference cells. Because the amount of uncomplexed protein available progressively decreases after each successive injection\, the magnitude of the peaks becomes progressively smaller until complete saturation is achieved. The difference between the concentration of bound ligand in the ith and (i-1)th injections depends on the binding constant Ka and the total ligand injected. The calculations depend on the binding model (number of substrates). Analysis of the data yields DH and DG = -RTlnKa.

A first mass spectrum (\"Normal mass spectrum\" or \"Q1 mass spectrum\") gives information about the masses of all the peptides. Peptides observed in the normal mass spectrum are isolated in turn and dissociated into fragments by collision with gas molecules within the mass spectrometer. Some of the fragments obtained from a peptide constitute a nested set\, differing by one amino acid\, and the mass difference between them allows assignment of a partial sequence. The masses of the fragments define the position of the partial sequence in the peptide. Together with the cleavage specificity of the protease used to cleave the protein\, and mass information such sequence tag provides much higher search specificity to match the a database entry. The procedure is repeated with several peptides from the digest\, resulting in multiple identifications of the same protein or identification of several proteins from the peptide mixture. Unknown proteins can easily be identified by using the high specificity of the peptide sequence tag for searches in most sequence databases including EST or genome databases."

def: "This method measures formation of complex by monitoring changes in the resonance angle of light impinging on a gold surface as a result of changes in the refractive index of the surface. A ligand of interest (peptide or protein) is immobilized on a dextran polymer\, and a solution of interacting protein is passed over it through a cell\, with a gold wall coated with this polymer. Macromolecules that interact with the immobilized ligand are retained on the polymer surface\, and alter the resonance angle of impinging light as a result of the change in refractive index brought about by the increased protein mass retained on the polymer surface. Since all proteins have the same refractive index and since there is a linear correlation between resonance angle shift and protein concentration near the surface\, this allows one to measure changes in protein concentration at the surface as a consequence of protein interaction. Furthermore\, this can be done in real time\, allowing direct measurement of both the on rate and the off rate of complex formation. " [PMID:12120258, PMID:11896282]

The fusion protein and associated components are recovered from cell extracts by affinity selection on an IgG matrix. After washing\, the TEV protease is added to release the bound material. The eluate is incubated with calmodulin-coated beads in the presence of calcium. This second affinity step is required to remove the TEV protease as well as traces of contaminants remaining after the first affinity selection. After washing\, the bound material is released with EGTA. This two steps purification steps ensures a highly selective complex purification of the \"Tapped\" protein (first round of selection on the protein A\, a high affinity tag) under mild condition (non denaturant pH or conditions required to remove the tag).

def: "The gene for DHFR is rationally dissected into two fragments called F\[1\,2\] and F\[3\]. Two proteins or protein domains that are thought to bind to each other can then be fused to either of the two DHFR fragments. Reconstitution of enzyme activity can be monitored in vivo by cell survival in DHFR-negative cells grown in the absence of nucleotides. A fluorescence assay can also be carried out taking advantage of fMTX (the third element of the so called triple hybrid essay) binding to reconstituted DHFR. The basis of this assay is that complementary fragments of DHFR\, when expressed and reassembled in cells\, will bind with high affinity (Kd 5 540 pM) to fMTX in a 1\:1 complex. fMTX is retained in cells by this complex\, whereas the unbound fMTX is actively and rapidly transported out of the cells. Survival depends only on the number of molecules of DHFR reassembled. " [PMID:10318894]

The two fragments do not associate to form a functional ubiquitin unless the two fused membrane proteins form a complex. The association is monitored by an ingenious trick. The C-term fragment of ubiquitin is expressed as a fusion to a transcription factor that being linked to a membrane protein cannot perform its function unless it is released form the ubiquitin fusion by a specific protease. This achieved through the activity of UBP (an ubiquitin specific protease) that cleaves off the reporter protein only when a functional ubiquitin is reconstituted." [PMID:9560251]

If a narrow parallel beam of X-rays is directed at a sample of a pure protein\, most of the X-rays will pass straight through it. A small fraction\, however\, will be scattered by the atoms in the sample. If the sample is a well-ordered crystal\, the scattered waves will reinforce one another at certain points and will appear as diffraction spots when the X-rays are recorded by a suitable detector. The position and intensity of each spot in the X-ray diffraction pattern contain information about the position and nature of the atoms in the crystal. The three-dimensional structure of a large molecule can be deduced from the electron-density map of its crystal. In recent years X-ray diffraction analysis has become increasingly automated\, and now the slowest step is likely to be the production of suitable protein crystals. This requires high concentration of very pure protein and empirical searching for the proper crystallisation conditions." [PMID:-]

name: two hybrid array
def: "Two-hybrid screening can be done in a colony array format\, in which each colony expresses a defined pair of proteins. Because the particular protein pair expressed in each colony is defined by its position in the array\, positive signals identify interacting proteins without further characterization\, thus obviating the need for DNA purification and sequencing. The interrogation of a two-hybrid colony array usually involves a mating strategy in which every DNAbinding domain hybrid (the bait) is tested against all activation domain hybrids (thepreys) in a grid pattern. Arrays usually use full-length open reading frames.\n\n" [PMID:11827624, PMID for application instance:10688190]
