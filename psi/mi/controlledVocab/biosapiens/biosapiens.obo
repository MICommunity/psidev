Kim and Raines using ESI-MS and sulfhydryl group titration found that bovine seminal ribonuclease contains a single oxidized sulfhydryl group, which cannot participate in a disulfide bond. This form of cysteine is called sulfenic acid (-SOH).

Proteome Res. 1, 181-187  (2002) Notes:A secondary modification affecting peptides with S-carbamoylmethyl-L-cysteine (CamC) at the N-terminus.  These exist in enzymatic digests of proteins that have been S-alkylated with iodoacetamide.  In a reaction that parallels the formation of N-terminal 2-oxopyrrolidine-5-carboxylic acid (also called pyroglutamic acid, 5-oxoproline or 2-pyrrolidone-5-carboxylic acid) from N-terminal glutamine,  cyclization of N-terminal CamC gives an N-terminal residue of (R)-5-oxoperhydro-1,4-thiazine-3-carboxylic acid. Peptides in which this has occurred become more hydrophobic, and lose 17 Da from the N-terminal residue.

comment: For amino acids residues, trimethylation can effectively only be accomplished with a protonated primary amino group. This process accounts only for trimethylation and not protonation. The alternative Me3+Res process accounts for both protonation and trimethylation.

comment: From DeltaMass: Average Mass: 48 Abbreviation:Cya Average Mass Change:48 Notes:Treatment of cysteine by strongly oxidising reagents such as performic acid results in the complete oxidation of the sulphur atom. Such treatment is often carried out prior to amino acid analysis as the resulting cysteic acid is then resistant to acid degradation during the hydrolysis procedure.

def: "modification from UniMod Artefact" [DeltaMass:235, PubMed:8597590, UniMod:276]
comment: From DeltaMass: Average Mass: 183 Average Mass Change:183 References:We have found that AEBSF modifies many proteins by covalent attachment, preferentially on Tyr, and to a lesser extent on Lys, His, and the amino- terminus. These modifications were identified by electrospray MS of the proteins (adds 183 Da per AEBS-group) and by peptide mapping and MS/MS. All the proteins we examined were modified after 24 hrs. at 4 C with 1 mM AEBSF in TRIS, pH 8.0. The reaction is 10-20x slower at pH 7; however AEBSF is quite stable in aqueous solution and the extent of to which the protein is modified continues to increase for several days. We have seen the addition of 10 or more AEBS-groups to proteins after prolonged storage. We found no equivalent modification from PMSF, probably because it degrades so quickly. We no longer use AEBSF,and urge caution to those who do.To address the problem, Boehringer Mannheim (now Roche Molecular Biochemicals) introduced Pefabloc PLUS which includes an additional component to compete for these side reactions. In our limited experience with Pefabloc PLUS, it reduces the +183 modifications, but does not always eliminate them. As a result, we prefer PMSF, despite its own set of drawbacks. We have never found PMSF-induced modification of proteins (except trypsin), probably due to its short half-life in aqeous solution.

comment: From DeltaMass: Average Mass: -34 Average Mass Change:-34 Notes:In an attempt to clarfiy the difference between the modification of cysteine to lanthionine and cysteine to dehydroalanine, the following contributions from the ABRF email forum are presented:Structurally speaking lanthionine is like cystine but lacks one S atom. I imagine one can think of it as a condensation of cysteine and dehydroalanine but I do not know how it is made biologically. Dehydroalanine could be derived from either serine or cysteine. If I recall Biochem 101 correctly lanthionine was first found in wool.-Lowell Ericsson (ERICSSONLH@U.WASHINGTON.EDU)As far as I know, the structure of lanthionine is two Ala's joined by a single sulphur with the loss of two hydrogens from the methyl group of the Ala.Stephen Bayne (sbay@novo.dk)Regarding the structure of lanthionine and dehydroalanine: dehydroalanine is formed by the loss of one sulfur atom and two hydrogen atoms from ONE cysteine residue. lanthionine is formed from TWO cysteines, is a thioether, and contains one sulfur atom less than the amino acid cystine.Dan McCormick (MCCORMICK@rcf.mayo.edu)

comment: From DeltaMass: Average Mass: -44 Formula:CO2 Average Mass Change:-44 References:Nakamura T, Yu Z, Fainzilber M, Burlingame AL.Protein Sci (1996) 5, 524-530Mass spectrometric-based revision of the structure of a cysteine-rich peptide toxin with gamma-carboxyglutamic acid, TxVIIA, from the sea snail, Conus textile. Notes:The elimination of CO2 will regenerate glutamate as if there was nomodification.  However,  peaks appearing with an interval of 44 isquite characteristic. It would be noteworthy to remind thatloss of 44 from a gamma-carboxyglutamate-containing peptide may be observed not only as a result of spontaneous decarboxylation but also as an artifact under some ionization conditions such as negative ion mode MALDI.

Mass Spectrom. 3(9), 314-19 Notes:Fast-atom bombardment mass spectrometry of a synthetic reninsubstrate decapeptide (Pro-His-Pro-Phe-His-Leu-Val-Ile-His-D-Lys)indicated the presence of several side products, including acomponent 12 Da higher in mass.

It is suggested that the formationof these side products is attributable to the generation offormaldehyde, during removal of the histidine protecting group(benzyloxymethyl), which reacts with the N-terminus of the peptideto give an imidazolidinone structure or with the D- ***lysine***.epsilon.-amine group to yield an ***imine*** . While theprecise genesis of the side-products remains speculative, it isclear that the combined strategy of derivatization and tandem massspectrometry has allowed structural conclusions concerningindividual components of an isobaric mixt.

The specimens were stored at -20 degrees C before analysis.The predominant crosslink in a normal bone collagen washydroxylysinohydroxynorleucine (di OH-LNL) (F1), which was designatedsyndesine in the past; another fraction, hydroxylysinorleucine (HLNL) (F2),musch less prominent than di OH-LNL, was also noted in a normal bone collagen.Both fractions were reduced in bone tissue of advancing age. The peakcorresponding to HLNL was considerably increased in Paget's disease. Thisabnormality was constantly seen in specimens of bone from cases of Paget'sdisease, but the significance of the finging could not be assessed from thepresent investigation. Calcitonin has been shown to produce complete remissionin Paget's disease and the crosslink pattern was found to be normal inspecimens examined froma calcitonin-treated patient. This shows thatcalcitonin has some effect on the metabolism of collagen and a normalcrosslink in such a situation lends support to this idea.MEDLINE ACCESSION NUMBER75151974

The net change from Lys to hydroxyallysine thus is +15.

The mechanism involves piperidine-mediated beta-elimination of sulfur (with the protecting group on), followed by addition of piperidine across the C-terminaldehydroalanine.  Since this last-mentioned step creates a chiral center, a mixture of diastereomers is formed which in special cases can be separatedby HPLC.<BR><BR>Another problem with C-terminal Cys  is racemization; some references in the review article by Andreu, Albericio, Sole, Munson, Ferrer, and Barany in Pennington-Dunn Peptide Synthesis and Purification Protocols, vol 35, 1994, pp. 91-169.

comment: From DeltaMass: Average Mass: 98 Abbreviation:Cya Average Mass Change:98 Notes:Treatment of cystine by strongly oxidising reagents such as performic acid results in the breakage of the disulphide bond and complete oxidation of the sulphur atoms on each molecule. Such treatment is often carried out prior to amino acid analysis as the resulting cysteic acid is then resistant to acid degradation during the hydrolysis procedure.

comment: From DeltaMass: Average Mass: 162 Average Mass Change:162 Notes:(from the ABRF discussion list archive) There may be ...  things in the reagent K that would allow cleavage of the peptide to occur at the wrong place...in this case it removes the dimethoxybenzyl group first inactivating that site for cleavage, and it goes after tne next amide bond closer to the resin. Try the TFA/TIS/water/EDT cocktail...TFA = 92%, TIS =3%, and water is at 5%. .. had this issue on longer peptides.. and by increasing the amount of water a little bit... able to elminate this problem.

comment: From DeltaMass: Average Mass: 359 Formula:C21H11O6 Monoisotopic Mass Change:359.055 Average Mass Change:359.315 Notes:Using the DHB matrix at low pH the carboxyl group and one of theoxygens on the flurorescein molecule are protinated so the delta mass is 2Da higher than most text book illustrations would indicate. SeeBioconjugate Techniques by Greg Hermanson, Academic Press, page 305,figure 204.Text books of course just show the coupling reaction at neutralor basic pH.

Hydrogen bonding occurs between every other C=O from one strand to every other N-H on the adjacent strand. In this case, if two atoms C-alpha (i)and C-alpha (j) are adjacent in two hydrogen-bonded beta strands, then they do not hydrogen bond to each other; rather, one residue forms hydrogen bonds to the residues that flank the other (but not vice versa). For example, residue i may form hydrogen bonds to residues j - 1 and j + 1; this is known as a wide pair of hydrogen bonds. By contrast, residue j may hydrogen-bond to different residues altogether, or to none at all. The dihedral angles (phi, psi) are about (-120 degrees, 115 degrees) in parallel sheets."
