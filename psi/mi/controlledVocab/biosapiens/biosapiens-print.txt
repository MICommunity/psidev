Curators therefore need to be careful, because an experiment considered as direct assay for a term from one ontology may be a different kind of evidence for the other ontologies. In particular, we thought of more kinds of direct assays for cellular component than for function or process. For example, a fractionation experiment might provide direct assay evidence that a gene product is in the nucleus, but protein interaction evidence for its function or process.

This code can therefore cover any of the IMP experiments that are done in a non-wild-type background, though we prefer to use it only when all mutations are documented. When redundant copies of a gene must all be mutated to see an informative phenotype, that's IGI. Some organisms, such as mouse, will have far, far more IGI than IMP annotations. Use IMP for phenotypic similarity, as described below. We have also decided to use this code for situations where a mutation in one gene (gene A) provides information about the function, process, or component of another gene (gene B; i.e. annotate gene B using IGI). Functional complementation above refers to experiments in which a gene from one organism complements a deletion or other mutation in another species. For these annotations, the with column can list the identifiers(s) for the gene(s) that complement(s) or is/are complemented by the gene of interest; the entry in the with column does not have to refer to the same species that is being annotated.

Use this code for experiments that use antibodies or other specific inhibitors of RNA or protein activity, even though no gene may be mutated (the rationale is that IMP is used where an abnormal situation prevails in a cell or organism due to the alteration of the sequence or expression of one gene). In addition to such 'abnormal' situations, IMP may also be used for experiments (e.g. QTL analyses) in which an inference is based on the observed effects of naturally occurring variations in a gene. In other words, 'normal' allelic variation in a population counts as IMP; there does not need to be a specifically designated 'mutant' or 'wild type' allele. IMP also covers phenotypic similarity: a phenotype that is informative because it is similar to that of another independent phenotype (which may have been described earlier or documented more fully) is IMP (not IGI).

There is no evidence whatsoever that this gene product has the cellular location nucleus, but this would be a perfectly reasonable inference for a curator to make (if the curator is annotating a eukaryotic gene product, of course). This inference would be linked to the annotation transcription factor activity in two ways: (i) both annotations would share the same reference, and (ii) the inferred annotation would include one or more from statements pointing to the GO term(s) used by the curator for the inference.

As noted above, IEA should be used for any computational annotations that are not checked for accuracy by a curator (or by the authors of a paper describing such analysis), and sequence comparisons that have been reviewed use ISS.

For recognized domains, attribution to any of the ontologies will probably be at low resolution.
