Stable nitroxide radicals can be bound to amino acid residues, in analogy with fluorescent probes.

Denaturants are removed during the blotting procedure, which allows many proteins to recover (or partially recover) activity. However, if biological activity is not recoverable, the proteins can be fractionated by a non denaturing gel system. This variation of the method eliminates the problem of activity regeneration and allows the detection of binding when the presence of a protein complex is required for binding. The protein probe can be prepared by any one of several procedures, while fusion affinity tags greatly facilitate purification. Synthesis in E. coli with a GST fusion, epitope tag, or other affinity tag is most commonly used.

This is accomplished experimentally by excitation with plane-polarized light, followed by measurement of the emission at parallel and perpendicular planes. Since rotational correlation times depend on the size of the molecule, this method can be used to measure the binding of two proteins because the observed polarization increase when a larger complex is formed. A fluorescence anisotropy experiment is normally carried out with a protein bearing a covalently added fluorescent group, which increases both the observed fluorescence lifetime of the excited state and the intensity of the fluorescent signal.

A variation of this technique has been used to show interaction of a DNA binding protein with another protein. In this case the DNA rather than protein is fluorescently labelled."

A typical ITC experiment is carried out by the stepwise addition of one of the reactants (~10-6 L per injection) into the reaction cell (~1mL) containing the second reactant. The chemical reaction occurring after each injection either releases or absorbs heat (qi) proportional to the amount of ligand that binds to the protein with a characteristic binding enthalpy (DH). As modern ITC instruments operate on the heat compensation principle, the instrumental response (measured signal) is the amount of power (microcalories per second) necessary to maintain constant the temperature difference between the reaction and the reference cells. Because the amount of uncomplexed protein available progressively decreases after each successive injection, the magnitude of the peaks becomes progressively smaller until complete saturation is achieved. The difference between the concentration of bound ligand in the ith and (i-1)th injections depends on the binding constant Ka and the total ligand injected. The calculations depend on the binding model (number of substrates). Analysis of the data yields DH and DG = -RTlnKa.

When the ribosome reaches the RNA-DNA junction the ribosome stalls and the puromycin moiety enters the peptidyltransferase site of the ribosome and forms a covalent linkage to the nascent polypeptide. As a result the protein and the mRNA are covalently joined and can be isolated from the ribosome and purified. In the current protocol, a cDNA strand is then synthesised to form a less sticky RNA-DNA hybrid and these complexes are finally used for affinity selection. As in most display approaches, several selections cycles (3-6) are sufficient to enrich for mRNAs encoding ligand proteins." [pubmed:11551470 "primary-reference"]

def: "NMR requires a small volume of concentrated protein solution that is placed in a strong magnetic field. Certain atomic nuclei, and in particular hydrogen, have a magnetic moment or spin; that is, they have an intrinsic magnetisation, like a bar magnet. The spin aligns along the strong magnetic field, but can be changed to a misaligned excited state in response to applied radio frequency (RF) pulses of electromagnetic radiation. When the excited hydrogen nuclei relax to their aligned state, they emit RF radiation, which can be measured and displayed as a spectrum. The nature of the emitted radiation depends on the environment of each hydrogen nucleus, and if one nucleus is excited, it will influence the absorption and emission of radiation by other nuclei that lie close to it. It is consequently possible, by an ingenious elaboration of the basic NMR technique known as two-dimensional NMR, to distinguish the signals from hydrogen nuclei in different amino acid residues and to identify and measure the small shifts in these signals that occur when these hydrogen nuclei lie close enough to interact: the size of such a shift reveals the distance between the interacting pair of hydrogen atoms. In this way NMR can give information about the distances between the parts of the protein molecule. NMR provides information about interacting atoms thereby permitting to obtain information about protein structure and protein-protein interaction."

The list of peptide masses obtained by MALDI MS is automatically compared to the calculated masses of the predicted peptide fragments for each entry in the database. High mass accuracy is very important in order to obtain a statistically significant and unambiguous match This method is best applied to completely sequenced genomes and well characterised proteomes. However, depending on the data quality, proteins that are highly homologous to already characterised proteins (greater than 80 to 90% sequence identity) can also be identified. The retrieved sequence are evaluated by mass accuracy of the peptides, matching of additional peptide masses in the MALDI spectrum after accounting for common modifications such as oxidation, acrylamidation of cysteine and missed cleavages and the use of secondary information (apparent isoelectric point and molecular weight). If any ambiguity about the identification by MALDI-MS still exists, the results must verified by an other identification method. Peptide mass fingerprint is generally carried out with a MALDI-TOF (Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight ) instrument but can also be achieved ESI-TOF (Electrospray Ionisation time-of-flight) or LC-MS (Liquid Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry) mass spectrometer."

Synthetic peptides that are identical with peptides synthesised in vivo are useful experimental tools for such studies. Peptides are routinely synthesised in a test tube from monomeric amino acids by condensation reactions that form peptide bonds. Peptides are constructed sequentially by coupling the C-terminus of a monomeric amino acid to the N-terminus of the growing peptide. To prevent unwanted reactions involving the amino groups and carboxyl groups of the side chains during the coupling steps, a protecting (blocking) group is attached to the side chains. Without these protecting groups, branched peptides would be generated. In the last steps of synthesis, the side chain-protecting groups are removed and the peptide is cleaved from the resin on which synthesis occurs." [pubmed:14755292 "primary-reference"]

This information is then used to automatically find the best match in a sequence database. A mixture of peptides derived from a protease digestion is analysed by nanoelectrospray LC-MS/MS (Liquid Chromatography Tandem Mass Spectrometer or nanoESI MS/MS) mass spectrometry. Electrospray mass spectrometry cannot be applied to dilute samples and is affected by high salt. As a consequence peptides, normally extracted from acrylamide gels by in situ proteolysis, are desalted and concentrated on a microcolumn followed by elution into a capillary used for nanoelectrospray tandem mass spectrometry. A first mass spectrum (Normal mass spectrum or Q1 mass spectrum) gives information about the masses of all the peptides. Peptides observed in the normal mass spectrum are isolated in turn and dissociated into fragments by collision with gas molecules within the mass spectrometer. Some of the fragments obtained from a peptide constitute a nested set, differing by one amino acid, and the mass difference between them allows assignment of a partial sequence. The masses of the fragments define the position of the partial sequence in the peptide. Together with the cleavage specificity of the protease used to cleave the protein, and mass information such sequence tag provides much higher search specificity to match the a database entry. The procedure is repeated with several peptides from the digest, resulting in multiple identifications of the same protein or identification of several proteins from the peptide mixture. Unknown proteins can easily be identified by using the high specificity of the peptide sequence tag for searches in most sequence databases including EST or genome databases."

Macromolecules that interact with the immobilized ligand are retained on the polymer surface, and alter the resonance angle of impinging light as a result of the change in refractive index brought about by the increased protein mass retained on the polymer surface. Since all proteins have the same refractive index and since there is a linear correlation between resonance angle shift and protein concentration near the surface, this allows one to measure changes in protein concentration at the surface as a consequence of protein interaction.

After reversal of the cross-links, the enriched DNA is amplified and labeled with a fluorescent dye (Cy5) by using a ligation-mediatedpolymerase chain reaction (LM-PCR). In parallel a sample of DNA that is not enriched by immunoprecipitation is subjected to LM-PCR in the presence of a different fluorophore (Cy3), and both immunoprecipitation (IP)-enriched and unenriched pools of labeled DNA were hybridized to a single DNA microarray containing a set of intergenic sequences. The ratio of the Cy5 to Cy3 fluorescence intensities measured at each DNA element in the microarray provided a measure of the extent of binding of the transcription factor to the corresponding genomic locus."

Protein that have a low density of net positive charge will tend to emerge first, followed by those having a higher charge density. Positively charged complexes or proteins (cationic proteins) can be separated on negatively charged carboxymethyl-cellulose (CM-cellulose) columns.

Coomassie does not act as a detergent and preserves the structure of complexes. Importantly, the resolution of BN-PAGE is much higher than that of other methods such as gel filtration or sucrose-gradient ultracentrifugation.

DMS induces methylation of guanine residues so DNA interaction with protein binding to AT rich sequences or to the phosphate backbone may be not detected by DMS footprinting. However as DMS diffuses across membrane it can also be used for in vivo footprinting. The experiment involves the treatment with DMS of two DNA samples with identical sequence, one protein bound and the other naked. The two samples are treated with piperidine to induce chemical cleavage of the DMS modified guanine residues followed by digestion with restriction enzymes. Once labelled the samples are run in parallel on a gel to visualize the pattern of nested fragments sharing a common end generated by restriction enzyme(or PCR primer extension) and a variable end guanine dependent. The missing bands of the protein bound sample correspond to the guanine residues protected from modification by an interaction." [pubmed:8238889 "primary-reference"]
