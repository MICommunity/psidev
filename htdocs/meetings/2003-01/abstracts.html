<h3>Steve Oliver, University of Manchester: A systematic approach to modelling capturing and disseminating proteomics
experimental data
</h3>

Both the generation and the analysis of proteome data are becoming
increasingly widespread, and the field is moving incrementally towards
high-throughput approaches. Techniques are also increasing in complexity as
the relevant technologies evolve. A standard representation of both the
methods employed and the data generated in proteomics experiments, analogous
to that of the MIAME guidelines for transcriptomics, and the associated MAGE
object model and XML implementation, has yet to emerge. This hinders the
handling, exchange and dissemination of proteomics data. We will present a
UML model of proteomics experimental data, describe XML and SQL
implementations of that model, and discuss capture, storage and
dissemination strategies. These make explicit what data might most usefully
be captured about proteomics experiments and provide complementary routes
towards the implementation of a proteome repository.

<h3>Michael Lappe, EBI: Covering Interaction Space</h3>
We address the problem of achieving completeness in functional genomics. By identifying a 
screening strategy with the order in which of the proteins are used as bait in the screening 
process we demonstrate that the learning curve (or information gain) is determined by the 
strategy applied to cover interaction space. 
The question of completeness seems to hinge on establishing a reliable ab-initio estimate of 
the degree of all proteins. Since we do not know the interaction network that is to be explored 
yet, all we know the list of nodes (proteins) and have to determine how they are connected 
(interacting) by experiments. Here we provide an efficient algorithmic solution to cover 
interaction space with an almost minimal effort in terms of  the required number of 
experiments. Our framework and tools allow, with the benefit of hindsight, to analyse the 
existing knowledge on protein Interactions and compare different strategies. Furthermore, we 
demonstrate it performs within ~75% of a theoretical optimum and is several times faster than 
random screening for exploring a new interactome.
The strategic relevance of this work lies in its ability to quickly generate an overall scaffold for 
functional prediction. The algorithm can easily be implemented based on current data 
suggesting the most promising baits for further experimental studies. In order to co-ordinate 
screening efforts the results will make an ideal supplement to public repositories like IntAct.

<h3>Yves Deville, Universite Libre de Bruxelles: Modelling protein-protein interactions in biochemical networks</h3>
Well-established databases for protein-protein interactions are usually limited to the representation of such interactions.  Protein-protein interactions play however an important role in many biochemical chemical processes, where the many interactions formed between components of the living cell (such as proteins DNA, RNA and small molecules) can be thought of as forming networks. We present a model allowing the representation of protein-protein interactions in such networks.  These interactions are thus connected to other data so as to represent the entire network in a way that also enables the analysis of the corresponding biochemical processes.
The presented model is object-oriented.  A prototype database has been developed.  It contains data, including protein-protein interactions, on signal transduction pathways in yeast. This prototype is part of the aMAZE  project.

<h3>Christian von Mering, EMBL: Comparative Assessment and Network Assembly</h3>
Large-scale experimental and computational approaches are currently generating valuable protein-protein interaction data in many model organisms. One of the best-covered organisms is yeast, and a comparative assessment of yeast interaction datasets can hel
p identify the potential of the various approaches, as well as their biases, strengths and weaknesses. Various ways to benchmark and compare interaction data are discussed, as well as approaches to integrate them into networks of interacting proteins. Part
icular emphasis is placed on computational methods for predicting functional interaction networks.
