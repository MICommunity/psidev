    <h1>PSI meeting October 2002</h1>
    <h3>Mass spectroscopy agenda</h3>

This is a preliminary, open agenda. Please send me any changes/additions.
    
    <ol>
      <li>What is the potential use of a public archive of mass spectrometry data?
	<ol>
	  <li>Confirmation of hypothetical proteins in sequence databases
	  <li>Making raw data available for third-party analysis and verification of 
	    experimental results. 
	    Example: Links from identified 2D gel spot to original spectrum.
	  <li>Re-analysing existing spectra with new approaches, or on the basis of new data,
	    for example updated versions of sequence databases.
	  <li>Improvement of future identifications by spectra comparison for
	    defined samples?
	  <li>Provision of reference sets from defined samples?
	</ol>
	    Aim: Describe intended uses and define their requirements, possibly split into
	    consecutive development phases.
	    
      <li>What data should be stored? 
	<ol>
	  <li>raw, instrument-dependent data
	  <li>instrument-independent data after noise reduction ("peak lists")
	  <li>interpreted data: Identifications (in which form)
	  <li>Scope of auxiliary data, for example source system: Should the auxiliary data allow to
	    recreate the experiment, or just
	    compare data from different experiments.
	  <li>Elements of auxiliary data:
	    <ol>
	      <li>source system: organism, cellstage, ..
	      <li>machine type
	      <li>experimental setup
	    </ol>
	  <li>data context: individual identifications of proteins versus 
	    "proteome of cell X" 
	</ol>
	
      <li>Which existing systems/controlled vocabularies/ontologies can be used, 
	where do we need additional systems?
      <li>Representation of proposed data format: XML/UML?
	  
	  <li>Beyond data format: Data collection
	    <ol>
	      <li>Database setup:
		<ol>
	      <li>central database, 
	      <li>federated database with data exchange, 
	      <li>federated database with common query interface?
	    </ol>
	  <li>data exchange: 
	  <li>flat/XML files
	  <li>Define availability levels:
	    <ol>
	      <li>free
	      <li>free to end user (no redistribution)
	      <li>only "detail" access via tools
	      <li>private
	      <li>Data ownership, update policy.
	    </ol>
	  <li>Quality control:
	    <ol>
	      <li>accept only published data? 
	    </ol>
	</ol>
	
      <li>Synchronised effort to create reference sets?
    </ol>
  </ol>
