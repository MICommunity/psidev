  <h2 align="center">PSI-MS XML Data Format</h2>
  <p align="left"><b></b>The aim of the PSI is to develop a standard representation 
    of experimental spectra in the context of the experimental setup and the analysed 
    system. Such a format will allow to support publications with detailed experimental 
    results, and will allow data exchange and the comparision of related proteomics 
    experiments beyond the local research team.</p>
  <p align="left"><a href="docs/mid-2003.sum.html">An overview of progess and 
    links to reports.</a></p>
  <p align="left">The PSI-MS team have developed an XML-based data standard which 
    is intended to allow data interchange for MS experiments - this format was 
    presented at the October HUPO World Congress in Montreal and updated based 
    on public comments.</p>
  <p align="left"><a href="xml/mzdata/index.html">Latest version of the schema 
    and it's documentation.</a></p>
  <p align="left">Java-based converters for popular peak-list formats are under 
    development as well as visualization and processing tools which use the format. 
    Send e-mail if you are interested in contributing to this effort or have comments 
    about the format.</p>
